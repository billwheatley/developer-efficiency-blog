# Funding DevOps for Success

Originally done as a talk at Red Hat Summit April 2020

Updated and turned into a Blog in September 2024

## What are DevOps Teams

There are many definitions out there but the effective teams are defined by several characteristics:

* Cross functional teams
* The team delivers a product
* Long lived teams
* Agile practices

### Cross Functional Teams

Team members collectively must be able to take on any role to deliver Software. The idea is that is everyone on a team is invested in the same goal, will strategically plans, tactically execute and reflect of their success and failures together. By doing this everyone shares ownership in the outcome. This avoids the silo'ed single function team trap that often ends up in a rivalrous us-vs-them relationship.

Some of these roles are:

* Product Owner
* Project Managers
* Application architects
* Application developers
* Automation developers
* Business analysts
* Testers
* Operations
* Data Architects
* Security
* Data Scientists
* Agile coach

Keep in mind not every function needs to be delivered by a separate member and not every member needs to be fulltime on the team, some roles are not as utilized to the same degree as others. Some roles may have multiple team members depending on the demand. Also not all teams will need every role listed here, for example applications not developing AI models will not need data scientists.  Each products demands may change over time and from time to time adjustments to staffing levels should be made.


### Delivers a Product

Has customers (can be internal) and delivers to their need.

#### Dev-x type team

### Long Lived Teams

It's a journey, team lives on until the product is obsolete.

### Agile Practices

Rapid small shipped changes, fast pivoting, backlogs.

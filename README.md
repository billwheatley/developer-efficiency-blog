## How this repo relates to the blog

This is the git repo to house artifacts for the blog and task track myself for this blog.  

This blog is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) + [so simple theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme?tab=readme-ov-file). Jekyll is a tool that takes content written in Markdown along with yaml configuration and plugins to generates a set of static html pages that work like a blog site.  These pages will be severed up in the near future for easy web browser viewing.

Please note in this repo that the Markdown has some links and elements that are geared to the Jekyll way of doing things and don't make complete sense as pure markdown viewed in Github.
